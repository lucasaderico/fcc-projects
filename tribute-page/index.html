          <p>Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 â€“ 20 March 1726/27) was an
          English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
          alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a
          natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution
          and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book
          Philosophi&#230; Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
          Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687,
          consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.
          He is considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists in
          history.</p>

          <p>In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal
          gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries
          until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his
          mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of
          planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the
          precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt
          about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the
          motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for
          by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate
          spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of
          Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European
          scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier
          systems. </p>
