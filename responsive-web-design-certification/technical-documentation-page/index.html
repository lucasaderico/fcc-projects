        <div class="hamb">|||</div>

        <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime
        environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p>

        <p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome,
        outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>

        <p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new
        thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O
        primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from
        blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using
        non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather
        than the norm.</p>

        <p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the
        network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking
        the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the
        operations when the response comes back.</p>

        <p>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections
        with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread
        concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.</p>

        <p>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend
        developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write
        the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the
        need to learn a completely different language.</p>

        <p>In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without
        problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their
        browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to
        use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific
        experimental features by running Node.js with flags.</p>

        <h3>An example Node.js application</h3>

        <p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a
        web server:</p>

        <pre class="overflow">
        <code>
          const http = require('node:http');

          const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
          const port = 3000;

          const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
            res.statusCode = 200;
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
            res.end('Hello World\n');
          });

          server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
            console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
          });
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>To run this snippet, save it as a <span
          class="span-hl">server.js</span> file and run <span
          class="span-hl">node server.js</span> in your terminal.</p>

        <p>This code first includes the Node.js <span
          class="span-hl">http</span> <span class="word-hl">module</span>.</p>

        <p>Node.js has a fantastic <span class="word-hl">standard library</span>, including first-class
        support for networking.</p>

        <p>The <span class="span-hl">createServer()</span> method of <span
          class="span-hl">http</span> creates a new HTTP server and returns
        it.</p>

        <p>The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name.
        When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case
        informing us that the server is running.</p>

        <p>Whenever a new request is received, the <span
          class="span-hl">request</span> <span class="word-hl">event</span> is called, providing two
        objects: a request (an <span
          class="span-hl">http.IncomingMessage</span> object) and a response
        (an <span class="span-hl">http.ServerResponse</span> object).</p>

        <p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>

        <p>The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this
        is not used, but you could access the request headers and request
        data.</p>

        <p>The second is used to return data to the caller.</p>

        <p>In this case with:</p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          res.statusCode = 200;
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful
        response.</p>

        <p>We set the Content-Type header:</p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to
        <span class="span-hl">end()</span>:</p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          res.end('Hello World\n');
        </code>
        </pre>

          target="_blank">https://github.com/nodejs/examples</a> for a list of
        Node.js examples that go beyond hello world.</p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          console.log('Goodbye World!');
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="How_to_install_Node.js">
        <header>How to install Node.js</header>

        <p>Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the
        most common and convenient ones. Official packages for all the major
        platforms are available at <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/"
        target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/download/</a></p>

        <p>One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package
        manager. In this case, every operating system has its own. Other
        package managers for MacOS, Linux, and Windows are listed in <a
        href="https://nodejs.org/download/package-manager/"
      target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/download/package-manager/</a>

        <p><span class="span-hl">nvm</span> is a popular way to run Node.js. It
        allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new
        versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks. It is also
        very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.</p>

        <p class="highlight">See <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"
          target="_blank">https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm</a> for more
        information about this option.</p>

        <p>In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the
        <span class="span-hl">node</span> executable program in the command
        line.</p>

        <header>How much JavaScript do you need to know to use Node.js?</header>

        <p>As a beginner, it's hard to get to a point where you are confident enough in
        your programming abilities. While learning to code, you might also be confused
        at where does JavaScript end, and where Node.js begins, and vice versa.</p>

        <h3>What is recommended to learn before diving deep with Node.js?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Lexical Structure</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Expressions</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Data Types</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Classes</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Variables</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Functions</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank"><span class="span-hl">this</span> operator</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Arrow Functions</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Loops</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Scopes</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Arrays</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Template Literals</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Strict Mode</a></li>
          <li><a>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>With those concepts in mind, you are well on your road to become a
        proficient JavaScript developer, in both the browser and in
        Node.js.</p>

        <h3>Asynchronous Programming</h3>

        <p>The following concepts are also key to understand asynchronous programming,
        which is one of the fundamental parts of Node.js:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Asynchronous programming and callbacks</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Timers</a></li>
          <li><a href="" target="_blank">Promises</a></li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Difference_between_Node.js_and_the_Browser">
        <header>Difference between Node.js and the Browser</header>

        <p>Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming
        language. Building apps that run in the browser is a completely
        different thing than building a Node.js application. Despite the fact
        that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make
        the experience radically different.</p>

        <p>From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses
        JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort
        of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single
        language.</p>

        <p>You have a huge opportunity because we know how hard it is to fully,
        deeply learn a programming language, and by using the same language to
        perform all your work on the web - both on the client and on the
        server, you're in a unique position of advantage.</p>

        <p class="highlight">What changes is the ecosystem.</p>

        <p>In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting
        with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not
        exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the <span
        class="span-hl">document</span>, <span class="span-hl">window</span>
      and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.</p>

        <p>And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js
        provides through its modules, like the filesystem access
        functionality.</p>

        <p>Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the
        environment. Unless you are building an open source application that
        anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will
        run the application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you
        don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use,
        this is very convenient.</p>

        <p>This means that you can write all the modern ES2015+ JavaScript that
        your Node.js version supports. Since JavaScript moves so fast, but
        browsers can be a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web you are
        stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases. You can use
        Babel to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to
        the browser, but in Node.js, you won't need that.</p>

        <p>Another difference is that Node.js supports both the CommonJS and ES
        module systems (since Node.js v12), while in the browser we are
        starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.</p>

        <p>In practice, this means that you can use both <span
          class="span-hl">require()</span> and <span
          class="span-hl">import</span> in Node.js, while you are limited to
        <span class="span-hl">import</span> in the browser.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_V8_JavaScript_Engine">
        <header>The V8 JavaScript Engine</header>

        <p>V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome.
        It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing
        with Chrome.</p>

        <p>V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript
        code. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs (they all makeup runtime
        environment) are provided by the browser.</p>

        <p>The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the
        browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of
        Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in
        2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine
        that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in
        JavaScript.</p>

        <p>The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to V8 which also powers
        desktop apps, with projects like Electron.</p>

        <h3>Other JS engines</h3>

        <p>Other browsers have their own JavaScript engine:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Firefox has <a href="" target="_blank">SpiderMonkey</a></li>
          <li>Safari has <a href="" target="_blank">JavaScriptCore</a> (also called Nitro)</li>
          <li>Edge was originally based on <a href="" target="_blank">Chakra</a> but has more recently been
            <a href="" target="_blank">rebuilt using Chromium</a> and the V8 engine.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>and many others exist as well.</p>

        <p>All those engines implement the ECMA ES-262 standard, also called
        ECMAScript, the standard used by JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>The quest for performance</h3>

        <p>V8 is written in C++, and it's continuously improved. It is portable
        and runs on Mac, Windows, Linux and several other systems.</p>

        <p>In this V8 introduction, we will ignore the implementation details
        of V8: they can be found on more authoritative sites (e.g. the V8
        official site), and they change over time, often radically.</p>

        <p>V8 is always evolving, just like the other JavaScript engines
        around, to speed up the Web and the Node.js ecosystem.</p>

        <p>On the web, there is a race for performance that's been going on for
        years, and we (as users and developers) benefit a lot from this
        competition because we get faster and more optimized machines year
        after year.</p>

        <h3>Compilation</h3>

        <p>JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but
        modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they
        compile it.</p>

        <p>This has been happening since 2009, when the SpiderMonkey JavaScript
        compiler was added to Firefox 3.5, and everyone followed this idea.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT)
        compilation to speed up the execution.</p>

        <p>This might seem counter-intuitive, but since the introduction of
        Google Maps in 2004, JavaScript has evolved from a language that was
        generally executing a few dozens of lines of code to complete
        applications with thousands to hundreds of thousands of lines running
        in the browser.</p>

        <p>Our applications can now run for hours inside a browser, rather than
        being just a few form validation rules or simple scripts.</p>

        <p>In this new world, compiling JavaScript makes perfect sense because
        while it might take a little bit more to have the JavaScript ready,
        once done it's going to be much more performant than purely interpreted
        code.</p>
